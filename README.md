# News-Driven Stock Movement Prediction using SVM

## üìò Overview

This repository contains the code and experiments for the Master's thesis project titled **"News-Driven Stock Movement Prediction using SVM."**

We build a binary classification model using Support Vector Machines (SVM), leveraging both:

- Financial news sentiment (from titles/headlines),
- Technical indicators from stock price data.

The target variable is the **future stock price movement** (up/down).  
We apply this model to KOSPI-listed shipbuilding and electrical equipment companies.
